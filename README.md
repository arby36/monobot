# MonoBot ∞ Discord Bot
A bot for my Discord server, Monotone 

Built on Discord.js 

Note, East Chat has turned into Monotone Server, therefore, we changed the bot's name from SidBot to MonoBot.

## To download and run:

Needs

• Node.js

• Discord.js

• (For Music SidBot) YTDL Core

• (For No Music SidBot, Feature still buggy) Readline Node.js Module 

1. Download Repo, extract the js file

2. In cmd: ```node <SidBot Js File Path>```

##Bugs and Errors

There are many bugs and errors in the code,

mostly with the cmd commands.
