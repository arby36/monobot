# MonoBot ∞ Discord Bot ∞ v.0.0.3
A bot for my Discord server, Monotone 

Built on Discord.js 

Note, East Chat has turned into Monotone Server, therefore, we changed the bot's name from SidBot to MonoBot.

Be sure to look at our Documentation at the Wiki Section!

## To download and run:

Needs

• Node.js

• Discord.js

• (For Music SidBot) YTDL Core

• (For No Music SidBot, Feature still buggy) Readline Node.js Module 

1. Download Repo, extract the js file

2. In cmd: ```node <SidBot Js File Path>```

Note: The one to use is the nomusic_sidbot_2 in the main folder.
