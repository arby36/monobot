Note, East Chat has turned into Monotone Server, therefore, we changed the bot's name from SidBot to MonoBot.

Be sure to look at our Documentation at the Wiki Section!

## To add the bot to your Discord Server

We got partial hosting with AWS, so hang tight. There will be outages!

Most stuff should be non-server specific.

##Bugs and Errors

*Bashing through new AND old bugs*, there should not be too many errors.

Wikipedia Challenge is dead, so that will be fixed in 0.0.6
