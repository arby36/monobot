Built on Discord.js 

#IMPORTANT
We recovered. We're now adding a buch on stuff to "spiff up" the repo, and make it more "downloadable".

Note, East Chat has turned into Monotone Server, therefore, we changed the bot's name from SidBot to MonoBot.

Be sure to look at our Documentation at the Wiki Section!

Add the bot to your server: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=204989362344034304&scope=bot&permissions=800

## To add the bot to your Discord Server

We got partial hosting with Heroku, so hang tight. There will be outages!

https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=204989362344034304&scope=bot&permissions=800

Most stuff should be non-server specific.

##Bugs and Errors

*Bashing through new AND old bugs*, there should not be too many errors.

Wikipedia Challenge is *still* dead. It's been put aside.
